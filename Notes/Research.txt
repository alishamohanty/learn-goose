Questions to Akshat/Srihari:
--------------------

Enqueued
--------
- Filter search, should it check all the keys in the goose?
  no, the keys will be selected by user in the ui. check updated ui
- The default view will have one queue selected with jobs data present in the queue or no job data?
  should have one queue selected by default and showcase its data

Scheduled
---------
- Do we show both scheduled-at and enqueued-at?
  yes
- Do we show countdown for the job to be enqueued or scheduled-at?
  yes
- Do we select multiple entries to be prioritised at once(to be made another endpoint) or allow one job to be prioritised at once(current design in mockup)?
  yes
- Where to place the Prioritise/Delete button in the page(Top or bottom)?
 top
- Do u think id is something to be showed in the table(sidekiq does not)?
 yes
 

Periodic
--------
- Do you want to delete the Cron job from the table itself?
  yes
- The args in the Job description (for :static :value), will it be okay if it is comma separated values?
  yes, thats how sidekiq shows
- What's your take on making Job description as a part of table?
  yes. When the information is long, the table would grow as well. Or we can have a scroller(if possible)


Batch
-----
- Do we need to show all the data in a batch metadata?
  - Yes ?

- Do we want to showcase the data as it is or do we want to have a label? 
	Like Callback-fn-symbol -> Callback function symbol
	     Linger-sec         -> Linger <time>sec

	Have a human readable form. like callback function symbol
- (Replace the - with space?) or have a label mapping
