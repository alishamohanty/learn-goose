What to test?
------------

1. Write specs client-opts in for the app-handler (done)
2. For "/" - It contains css, -logo.png request (done)
3. For "" - route to "/" (done)

4. ".css" file is loaded (done)
5. ".png" file is loaded  (done)

6. Test app handler with correct opts (done)
7. Test app handler with incorrect opts (specs test cover this)

8. Dispatching the handler to redis broker (done)
9. The jobs-size fn should construct correct structure of different key and value entities. (done)

10. Not found test (done)

Todo
-----
- Make the add-jobs test more efficient and good looking not like some jugad (done)
- Separate tests into different sections (done)
- Do we want to assert on the arguments received when stubbing? (can skip, if required in future, can add)
- Test app-handler with incorrect args (not required. this is guarded by specs)
- Add specs for the client-opts. Should it be called client-opts or console-opts or console-client-opts? (client-opts is fine)
- Assert on the navbar-view (to be made in sperate PR so that if it gets heavy, can be discarded)
