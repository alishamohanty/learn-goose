TODOS:

To be Figure out (by me)
------------------------
- Enqueued Queue: 
  - Delete multiple jobs? (how to multiple commands)
  - Get count for all the queues gotten from (list-all-queues)
  - How to add Visual button to limit filter result
  (Or how to co-ordinate the pagination with the filter by pattern's limit).

- Scheduled Page:
  - How to differentiate jobs that are scheduled for retries and that are actually scheduled!
  - Delete multiple scheduled jobs
- Figure out a way to select multiple dead jobs and retry them? Can we batch the query and send the ids to be retried?

- Check with Akshat if its okay to build additional APIs mentioned in Requirements doc?
